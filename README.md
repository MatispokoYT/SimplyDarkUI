# SimplyDarkUI
A UI using the 28, 28, 28 as the main colour

## Detailed info
This is my attempt for a unified UI for apps that support CSS and later a GTK/QT theme

## Disclaimer
The Waybar UI is based of the default config so it'll actually look like something and it's **heavily** modified. \
I don't own Wofi, Firefox, Waybar.

## Progress
UI for Wofi: Y \
UI for Firefox: Y (not polished enough) \
UI for the Waybar: Y \
UI for Millennium* (Steam addon for Theming and Plugins): N \
A GTK Theme**: N \
A QT Theme**: N \
\* Probably will add or will not \
\** Even less possible but it'll look good with the design I'm doing \

## How to Install
TBD
